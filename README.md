# Cool Domains
Application on Polygon network to build a custom domain name similar to ENS (Ethereum Name Service). For ENS they have .eth domain that you see being used all over the place.
For this specific smart contract, I'm going to build TNS = Trader name Service as an example. 
So it will be .trader for the domain.
